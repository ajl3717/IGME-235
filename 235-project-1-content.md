*Proposal

##High concept
Like Advance Wars but with the 4 elements.

##Genre
Strategy

##Platform
Universal

##Story
After years of conflict, the elements finally decided to try to take over the world and defeat the other elements.

##Esthetics
Cartoonish graphics with 8-bit sound during battle and on the UI

##Gameplay
Turn-based game using touch or mouse controls to declare actions. You can build your army, take over new land,
fight the enemy, move your troops, or just wait to see what the opponent will do. There will be instructions when
you first start the game, and the pause menu will have an instructions option. The player will need to learn how to
manage his troops and which troops are stronger against others in order to defeat the opponents. Time management would
also be useful for the player as he doesn't want to wait too long to start growing his army because he might get
overwhelmed by his opponents that might.
